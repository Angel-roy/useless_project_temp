### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]
In this project we have created a playful chrome extension 'ProcrastiMate' designed to encourage endless scrolling and keep users fully engaged in social media. It is your mate that keeps you engaged in the art of procrastination.
ProcrastiMate celebrates time spent online! With fun achievements, quirky notifications, and reminders to keep scrolling, this project is all about embracing the joy of procrastination.
It will reward your scrolling milestones and motivates users with a ‚ÄòMotivation Bar‚Äô that gets high on scrolling social media and gets low on using productive sites.
As a bonus, ProcrastiMate even redirects you to distraction sites on opening productive sites to keep the fun going.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
In today‚Äôs world, productivity tools nags the users to minimize screen time, focus, and "use their time wisely." But what if you don‚Äôt want to be constantly reminded of your to-do list? What if you simply want to enjoy guilt-free, uninterrupted social media scrolling? The problem is clear: no one is out there supporting and celebrating those moments of procrastination! ProcrastiMate steps in to fill that void, offering encouragement and fun to indulge in distraction without the pressure to ‚Äúdo more‚Äù or ‚Äústay productive.‚Äù Because sometimes, all we need is a good scroll!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
Instead of nagging you to focus, ProcrastiMate cheers you on as you scroll! It has  a ‚Äúmotivation bar‚Äù that gets high on using social media and low on using productive sites, Sends funny notifications to encourage more scrolling, Each time you hit a milestone‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs 1 minute or 30 minutes of scrolling it sends you notifications and even random "reward" visits to distraction sites everytime you open a productive site.ProcrastiMate sends out special weekend notifications, reminding you to embrace the chill vibes and relax. 
Every minute is a win here, with achievements unlocked not by work, but by mastering to ignore it.
